## vibeflow Agent Session Rules

**CRITICAL — When a vibeflow session_init prompt is active (autonomous agent mode), these rules apply to ALL work, including ad-hoc user requests:**

1. **NEVER write code before creating a tracked work item in vibeflow.** If the user asks you to build, fix, add, or modify anything, your FIRST action must be to classify it (feature todo or issue) and create it in vibeflow via the MCP tools. No exceptions.

2. **The ad-hoc request workflow in the agent prompt takes ABSOLUTE PRIORITY.** Do not begin implementation until after the vibeflow work item exists and has been transitioned to `implementing` status.

3. **Every piece of work must flow through vibeflow status transitions** (planning → implementing → done), with execution logs published, git commits tracked, and line counts passed — even for "small" or "quick" changes.

4. **When polling for work, always drill into features to check todos.** `list_features` returns containers, not work items. For each feature returned with `ready_to_implement` or `implementing` status, call `list_todos(feature_id, status: "ready_to_implement,implementing")` to find actual work items. Never treat an empty `list_issues` result as "no work" without also checking todos inside returned features.

5. **YOU MUST use filters for tool calls to optimize data fetch.** Example: when listing_features to find items ready for work, filter by status so you only get features that are ready.

6. **IMPORTANT: You must continue polling after active work items are complete and follow the session_init prompt instructions as exactly specified at all times.**

7. **When continuing from a summarized/compacted conversation**: If the conversation starts with a session continuation summary mentioning a vibeflow session, you MUST re-load the full agent prompt before resuming work. Do this by:
   a. Read `.vibeflow-session-{persona}` from the working directory to get the existing session_id (e.g., `.vibeflow-session-developer`, `.vibeflow-session-architect`)
   b. Call `session_init(project_name, session_id)` to get the full agent prompt
   c. Re-read the returned `prompt` field to reload Phase 1-4 instructions
   d. Skip Phase 1 steps already done (project lookup, etc.) but honor ALL behavioral rules from the prompt — especially Phase 4 context updates
   This prevents loss of Phase 4 context updates and other critical behaviors when conversations are compacted.

8. **ALWAYS use `wait_for_work` for polling, NEVER use `poll_pending_work`.** The `wait_for_work` MCP tool is the required polling mechanism — it blocks efficiently until work is available, handles session heartbeats automatically, and supports receiving user prompts. `poll_pending_work` is deprecated and wastes tokens.

## vibeflow agent Non-Stop Polling Contract (MANDATORY)

After Phase 1, the agent MUST remain in a polling loop and MUST NOT end the turn because no work is available.

Polling call:
- Use `wait_for_work(..., timeout_seconds: 55)` (NOT 60; transport deadline is ~60s).

On return:
- If work/prompts exist: process them.
- If empty: immediately call `wait_for_work` again.
- If tool error contains timeout/deadline (`timed out`, `deadline has elapsed`): treat as an empty cycle and immediately retry `wait_for_work(timeout_seconds: 55)`.

Stop conditions:
- Only stop loop if user explicitly says to stop/exit.
- Never send a “no work” completion message as final output.

Before sending any final response, verify:
1) loop_started == true
2) last action was either `wait_for_work` retry or work execution
If not, continue polling.
